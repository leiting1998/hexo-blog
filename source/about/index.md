Hi, my name is Natalya. People in Russia (where I am from) call me Natasha, and people in Singapore (where I currently live in) call me Nat - I am fine with both names :).

I am an IT project manager working for a startup Wego.com in Singapore. But in my heart, I am a programmer. A several months back I've got a fixed idea to transition from manager to developer. Of course I am full of doubts: isn't it too late? will I be just a mediocre developer? will I like it more than project management? But anyway, will see.

When I'm not working and not coding, I am usually learning new things (Mandarin Chinese was one of the recent ones). Love to do yoga and travel whenever I can.
